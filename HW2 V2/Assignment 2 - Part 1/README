===========================
Airport Simulation - Part 1
===========================

This program implements a simulation of the arrival, landing, and disappearance 
of aircrafts at an airport with a single runway. 


Install
=======

On Unix-based platforms (Mac or Linux), simply run the "make" command from your
terminal. This will generate a program called sim_airport

This will read the file called Makefile, and compile the program accordingly.
On Jinx, it is required that the -lm flag is specified when using the math.h 
library. I have enabled this flag in the Makefile. For those running it locally 
(especially on Mac), you may want to disable this flag before running make (you 
may leave it there, but it'll likely generate warnings).

Execute
=======

After "make", simply run ./sim_airport


Notes
=====

In main.c, a macro called VERBOSE is defined that, when enabled, prints out 
information about the arrival, landing, and disappearance of each aircraft.
To disable this, simply comment out the line "#define VERBOSE".

To increase the number of arrivals, update the variable MAX_ARRIVALS in main.c
